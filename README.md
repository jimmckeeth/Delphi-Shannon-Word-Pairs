This was created to demonstrate the process of using ChatGPT to generate Delphi code while also highlighting the similarities between Claude Shannon's word pairs and large langauge models.

## Contents:

* [Shannonizer.pas](https://github.com/jimmckeeth/Delphi-Shannon-Word-Pairs/blob/main/Shannonizer.pas) is the core of the word pair analysis and generation system.
* [Sample](https://github.com/jimmckeeth/Delphi-Shannon-Word-Pairs/tree/main/Sample) folder contains a FireMonkey sample app and some test data based on [Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet](https://github.com/jimmckeeth/Delphi-Shannon-Word-Pairs/blob/main/Sample/Romeo.txt).
* [Tests](https://github.com/jimmckeeth/Delphi-Shannon-Word-Pairs/tree/main/Tests) contains a small battery of DUnitX unit tests.
